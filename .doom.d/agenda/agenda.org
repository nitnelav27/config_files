#+TITLE: Agenda in Org
#+DESCRIPTION: This is my agenda file for Org-mode. Apparently, =org= can do anything. Therefore, why not trying the agenda?
#+STARTUP: overview

This is my agenda file. It will be divided into sections, for every component of my tasks.

* General tasks [0/1]
** TODO Look in to =org-super-agenda= [0/2]

- [X] Switch the /axis/ of $\ell$ and $a$ in the plots of $f$

All information is in my email. In the meantime, the first step is to write a draft for the abstract

** READ Look for the basic papers needed to write the empirical results [0/2]
- [ ] Papers about phone calls in general
- [ ] Papers about communication in general
** TODO Create a separate phone call dataframe from MIT
The idea in this dataframe is that looking at the /first appeareance of egos/ plot, I can /guesstimate/ $d$ days to make an adjustment to the data. The maximum lifetime of any alter that appear on day $d$ will be $T - d$. Therefore, the maximum value I will consider for the new dataset will be exctly that, $T - d$.
